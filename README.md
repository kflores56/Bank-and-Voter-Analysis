# Python Challenge

### This challenge included tasks to write two codes:
  - PyBank
  - PyPoll 

### PyBank

This code will analyze the included bank data to find:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total of profits/losses
  - The average change in month-to-month profits/losses
  - The greatest increase in profits and associated date
  - The greatest decrease in profits and associated date
  
Note: There are two codes included for this task. I believe that mainV1.py is more correct but wanted to include both for reivew, if possible. If only one review is possible then I submit mainV1.py 

### PyPoll

This code will analyse the include poll results to find:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - Each candidate and their corresponding percentage and number of votes won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote
